This project is based off the work of

 I originally just designed some LED diffusers to stick in his original model.  There were a few 
 things about the original I didn't like.  The housing wasn't snap-fit or screwed together. It needed
 either glue or tape to keep it together.  I hate to use glue on stuff I build because I expect that at some point 
 I'll think of some way to improve the model.  And the tape I used looked quite crappy.  Not something I wanted to look
 at every time I pulled into the garage. So....
 
 I designed the stop light housing from scratch in Fusion 360, using some of the measurements from Ty's original model.  It's about as parametric as I can make it.  If something doesn't fit, change it.     
  
 All three parts can be printed without supports, as they exist in the .stls.   
  
 If you print the housing as provided you will need some (qty 8) M3 screws.  I used M3x6, but I made the holes deep enough to use 
 up M3x12 (I think).  If you've got a 3D printer, you probably have some M3 screws around.  
 
 You'll note that there is a space for snap-fitting something onto the cover.  It's the Adafruit Perma-Proto Quarter Sized Breadboard.  I used this to make all the connections.  
  
 There are the different components I used from Ty's writeup given above,  
 I used them mostly because I had them sitting around.  I had to change the code to set all the encoder pins as PULLUP for the one I used.
